## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in semantic HTML and responsive CSS. I learned how to use Flexbox and Grid together for layout, and how to style lists and tables for better readability.

```html
<h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
```
```css
.section-title {
  font-family: "Young Serif", serif;
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning about accessibility and advanced CSS techniques, such as animations and transitions.
